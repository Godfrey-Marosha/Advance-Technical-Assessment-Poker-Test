# Advance-Technical-Assessment-Poker-Test
Created using Apache Netbeans & Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Technical Requirements
▪ The application is developed as a console application Java.
▪ I included a build script which can compile, package and run the application.
▪ The application code is also properly unit tested, and the build script is able to run the unit tests.


Firstly, make sure you run the system on UTF-8 to display card suits.

The standard 5 card poker hand strength applies. Listed in decreasing rank, these hands are:
1. Straight Flush
2. Four of a Kind
3. Full House
4. Flush
5. Straight
6. Three of a Kind
7. Two Pair
8. One Pair
9. High Cards

  * When VM Options is set to J-DFile.encoding=utf-8
  * UTF-8 PrintStream: 
    Your hand:  3♣ 7♦ 7♥ 7♠ K♥

Go to: Poker-advance-tech.
PokerTest.java, which is the Main class.
There you can be able change the number of poker hands simulated by simply changing the "HANDS" variable in the poker-advance-tech.PokerTest.java class.

private static final int HANDS = 100;

Five-card draw is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards. This Java console application is a simulation of drawing N random 5-card hands from a standard 52 card deck. Like the five-card draw variant, the application will have to deal a hand of 5 cards, but unlike the five-card draw variant, no swapping will be allowed.

Enjoy!
