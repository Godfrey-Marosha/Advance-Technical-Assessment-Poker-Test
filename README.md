Five-card draw is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards. This Java console application is a simulation of drawing N random 5-card hands from a standard 52 card deck. Like the five-card draw variant, the application will have to deal a hand of 5 cards, but unlike the five-card draw variant, no swapping will be allowed.

Enjoy!
